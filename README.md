# Index Coop Composite Strategy Backtesting App

## Overview

This project aims to create a simple tool for backtesting strategies to see the historical performance of a sector or theme according to a preset methodology. It will be used during the product development process to illustrate historical returns. It will also be used by Index Coop Informational Indices (ICII).

## Features

The user should be able to select a variety of whitelisted assets from CoinGeckoâ€™s token list representing the eligible asset universe. Then, the user will select a backtest start date, a methodology from a list of pre-designed methodologies, and a rebalance schedule. The user will also be able to select a benchmark asset. The application will fetch the daily price, circulating market capitalisation (CMC), and total supply and, from the price and total supply, derive a fully diluted valuation (FDV).

The application will then run a backtest from the start date utilizing the eligible asset universe, the selected methodology, and rebalance cadence.

The application will return the results of the backtest versus the benchmark.

Inputs:
- Eligible Assets
- Start Date
- Rebalance Cadence
- Methodology
- Circulating Market Capitalization
- Fully Diluted Valuation


- Max Assets
- Minimum Market Capitalisation

## Methodologies

- Equal: Weight each component equally as long as it is eligible.
- Circulating Market Capitalisation: Weight each component according to its Circ. MC
- Capped 25% Circulating MC: Same as Circ. Market Cap, but if a component has a weight > 30%, lower it to 25% and distribute the remaining amount proportionally to eligible strategies
- Square Root Market Cap: Weight each component accord to the square root of its circulating market cap
